# Python_Discord_Bot

This is a fun discord bot I made with discord.py for my friends and I to use on our server.

As of right now there are only a few commands.  

## mp3: 
This command is called by typing `=mp3 <soundbite name>`  
  The bot will join the voice chat and play a selected soundbite, then leave the call.
  
## tts:   
This command is called by typing `=tts <tts message>`  
  Discord already has a default tts, but I did not know that before making this.  
  Regardless, the tts is different because the bot joins the voice channel to say its message.  
  
## ytmp3: 
This command is called by typing `=ytmp3 <youtube url>`  
  This command will download a YouTube video's audio and then play it in the voice channel.  
  If a video is over 45 seconds long, it will not be played. However, an admin can override this.  

## help:  
This command is called by typing `=help`  
  This command will display a help page which desribes each command and also shows the available soundbites for the mp3 command.
